        <div class="header">Why is supply chain management important
</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="cell color-1">
            <p><strong></strong>  Effective supply chain management systems minimize cost, waste and time in the production cycle. The industry standard has become a just in time supply chain where retail sales automatically signal replenishment orders to manufacturers. Retailers can then restock shelves almost as quickly as they sell products. One way to further improve on this process is to analyze the data from supply chain partners to see where to improve further.

<p>By analyzing partner data, identifies scenarios where effective supply chain management increases value to the supply chain</p>

<strong>Identifying potential problems</strong>
<p>When a customer orders more products than the manufacturer can deliver, the buyer can complain of poor service. Through data analysis, manufacturers might be able to anticipate the shortage before the buyer is disappointed.</p>

<strong>Optimizing price dynamically</strong>

<p>Seasonal products have a limited shelf life. At the end of the season, retailers typically scrap these products or sell them at deep discounts. Airlines, hotels and others with perishable “products” typically adjust prices dynamically to meet demand. By using analytic software, similar forecasting techniques can improve margins, even for hard goods.</p>

<p>AImproving the allocation of “available to promise” inventoryA nalytical software tools help to dynamically allocate resources and schedule work based on the sales forecast, actual orders and promised delivery of raw materials. Manufacturers can confirm a product delivery date when buyers place orders significantly reducing incorrectly-filled orders.</p>

<strong>Planning</strong>

<p>Plan and manage all resources required to meet customer demand for a company’s product or service. When the supply chain is established, determine metrics to measure whether the supply chain is efficient, effective, delivers value to customers and meets company goals.</p>

<strong>Sourcing</strong>

<p>Choose suppliers to provide the goods and services needed to create the product. Then, establish processes to monitor and manage supplier relationships. Key processes include: ordering, receiving, managing inventory and authorizing supplier payments.</p>

<strong>Manufacturing</strong>

<p>Organize the activities required to accept raw materials, manufacture the product, test for quality, package for shipping and schedule for delivery.</p>

<strong>Delivery and logistics</strong>

<p>Coordinate customer orders, schedule deliveries, dispatch loads, invoice customers and receive payments.</p>

<strong>Returning</strong>

<p>Create a network or process to take back defective, excess or unwanted products.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="cell color-2">
            <p><strong></strong> The supply chain is the most obvious “face” of the business for customers and consumers. The better and more effective a company’s supply chain management is, the better it protects its business reputation and long-term sustainability.<p>

<strong>1. Connected:</strong> Accessing unstructured data from social media, structured data from the Internet of Things (IoT) and more traditional data sets available through traditional enterprise resource planning (ERP) and business-to-business (B2B) integration tools.</p>

<strong>2. Collaborative:</strong> Improving collaboration with suppliers increasingly means the use of cloud-based commerce networks to enable multi-enterprise collaboration and engagement.<p>

<strong>Cyber-aware:</strong> Hardening systems and protecting them from cyber-intrusions and hacks is a crucial enterprise-wide concern for the supply chain.</p>

<strong>Cognitively enabled:</strong> Collating, coordinating, and conducting decisions and actions across the chain, the AI platform serves as the modern supply chain's control tower, enabling most of the supply chain to be automated and self-learning.</p>

<strong>Comprehensive:</strong> Scaling analytics capabilities with data in real time to ensure that insights are comprehensive and fast is critical, as latency is unacceptable in the future supply chain.</p>

<p>Many supply chains have begun this process, with participation in cloud-based commerce networks at an all-time high and with major efforts underway to bolster analytics capabilities.</p>

<p>Modern supply chains take advantage of massive amounts of data that the chain process generates and that analytical experts and data scientists curate. Future supply chain leaders and the ERP systems they manage will likely focus on optimizing the usefulness of this data—analyzing it in real time with minimal latency.</p>

Inventory management, a critical element of the supply chain, is tracking inventory from manufacturers to warehouses and from these facilities to the point of sale.</p>

<strong>Electronic data interchange (EDI)</strong>

<p>EDI is the intercompany communication of business documents in a standard format. It is a standard electronic format that replaces paper-based documents such as purchase orders or invoices.<p>

<strong>Supply chain analytics</strong>

<p>Supply chain analytics helps to make sense of the massive amounts of data a supply chain generates by uncovering patterns and generating insights.</p>


<strong>Supply chain optimization</strong>

<p>Supply chain optimization makes use of technology and resources like blockchain, AI and IoT to maximize efficiency and performance in a supply network.</p>

<strong>Food trust</strong>

<p>Agritech Food Trust is a collaborative network of growers, processors, wholesalers, distributors, manufacturers, retailers and others, enhancing visibility and accountability across the food supply chain.</p>
